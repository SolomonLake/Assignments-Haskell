# Assignments-Haskell

Will need Haskell installed on your machine to run these files. Will also need various cabal "libraries" that are specified in hs files.

This is a collection of assignments that I completed for my functional programming class. These assignments vary from basic Haskell functions to using Haskell to pull and parse data from a webpage.
